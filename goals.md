### (a work in progress)

_After 4 months at Epicodus, I have learned much.  Beginning with no experience in computer programming to building APIs and developing fully functioning websites.  Just because my course has come to an end does not mean that there is no more to learn.  Below are goals that I plan to accomplish post-Epicodus and the list will change over time._


### Goals

#### 1) _Practice algorithms in HackerRank to improve my whiteboarding skills and overall ability to code._
#### 2) _Refactor and test projects in GitHub that I plan to showcase._
#### 3) _Update READMEs and commits on my projects in GitHub._
#### 4) _Attend a meetup for Women Who Code and become actively involved in the group, even post-employment._
#### 5) _Use Code Academy to learn more about data science and SQL_
#### 6) _Read the Well Grounded Rubyist._
#### 7) _Read JavaScript: The Definitive Guide._
#### 8) _Now that I have knowledge what was being accomplished in each unit, review Epicodus course material so that I can solidify concepts and build my confidence as a programmer._
#### 9) _Work through the lesson on Sass on the Epicodus website to understand more about styling._
#### 10) _Find like minded women who are interested in beginning a scholarship program for single mothers how are interested in learning how to code to improve their income and allow them to spend more time with their children._
#### 11) _Learn how to code pure JavaScript minus jQuery by using tutorials on Lynda.com._
#### 12) _Continue to build functionality for the plant website that was created as a group project in JavaScript._
#### 13) _Continually update the website that I am creating for my sister, per her needs._
#### 14) _Deploy Portfolio to Heroku._
#### 15) _Attend Metal Toad meetings on the weekends._
#### 16) _Make at least 3 new connections on LinkedIn per week._
#### 17) _Read the book Wine Folly and do research on wine regions and products in preparation for an App that I am interested in creating._
#### 18) _Do 10 minutes of CodeWars every morning on my phone to practice my algorithmic skills._
#### 19) _Deploy projects that I showcase in my Resume and LinkedIn to Heroku._
#### 20) _Use meet ups and programmers that I know to find an individual who would be interested in mentoring me_


### Top 5 Goals

#### 1) _Practice algorithms in HackerRank to improve my whiteboarding skills and overall ability to code._
#### 2) _Refactor and test projects in GitHub that I plan to showcase._
#### 3) _Deploy Portfolio to Heroku._
#### 4) _Learn how to code pure JavaScript minus jQuery by using tutorials on Lynda.com._
#### 5) _Use Code Academy to learn more about data science and SQL._


### Action Plan

_Over the Christmas break I plan to code... and code... and code.  At the top of the list is to prepare myself for interviews.  Refactoring and rebuilding developed projects in GitHub will not only help to improve my portfolio, but also refresh my memory as to Frameworks and Languages that I have not used for bit. I will incorporate daily algorithm practice.  Once internships are assigned, not only will I be busy with any work the company gives to prepare me to work, I also plan to watch tutorials online through Lynda.com and Treehouse to gain a further understanding of my job. These are my immediate goals and plans which will change over time.
